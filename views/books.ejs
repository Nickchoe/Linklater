  <h5 class="py-2 text-left">The classic voice-training for actors, teachers of voice and anyone interested in vocal expression - by a pre-eminent voice teacher, actor and director. Fully revised and expanded edition. Linklaterâ€™s approach is to liberate the voice you have rather than apply vocal techniques from the outside. Her basic assumption is that everyone possesses a voice capable of expressing whatever emotion, mood or thought he/she experiences.</h5>

<h5 class="py-2 text-left">"This book is a classic. Beyond the detailed technical expertise it contains, it resonates, in the ample sense of the word, with anyone slightly aware of the relation between mind and body. I only wish I would be disciplined enough to follow its teachings without fail. I know I would find and liberate whatever my natural voice is."</h5>
